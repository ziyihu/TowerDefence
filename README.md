# TowerDefenceU3D
This is a tower defence game using C# language.
This game is based on the Unity3d 4.6 version.
Download the game and run it in the Unity3d.

Currently, there are five types of towers in the game.
1. basic tower: can attack one enemy
2. shotgun tower: can attack at least on enemy in the attack range, the maximum number is four enemies
3. slow tower: the enemies in the range will move slower than the others
4. missile tower: the tower can shot a missile and cause an explosion, the enemies in the explosion area will be attacked
5. laser tower: the tower will cause high damage

There are mines(for resources), generators(for energy) and reasearch labs(for research points).
There is also a technology tree in the game, the more unlocked node in the tree, the more technology you will have.

The other ideas are
Small mine: slow resource acquisition
Large mine: fast resource acquisition

Small generator: generates a little bit of power
Large generator: generates a lot of power

Targeting facility: increases the damage of nearby towers
Research labs: generates research point over time
Supercapcitor: increases the rate of fire of nearby towers

This project begins on January, 15th.
I hope I can finish it on Febaray 30th.
